## Overview

**BunkCalc** is a browser extension designed for Amrita University students. It automatically scrapes attendance data from the official student portal and provides:

* **Bunkable Classes**: Maximum lectures you can skip while maintaining at least 75% attendance.
* **Recovery Classes**: Minimum lectures you need to attend if you’re below the threshold.

Access real-time stats through a floating widget or via the extension popup—no manual entry needed.

---

## Motivation (Why)

In my first year, I built a simple HTML/CSS/JS tool with my friend [Hemanth](https://github.com/hmnth-21) called [CampusCalc](https://github.com/midhunann/CampusCalc.git) to calculate attendance manually for any college. Although functional, it required manual entry for each course and was time-consuming.

**BunkCalc** evolved from CampusCalc to:

1. Automatically scrape attendance data directly from our portal
2. Save significant time, so you can focus on studies or well-earned breaks
3. Eliminate human error with robust parsing and validation logic
4. Provide instant insights through an interactive floating widget and popup UI

## How It Works

<details>
<summary>1. Content Script Injection</summary>

* Targets URLs under `https://students.amrita.edu/client/class-attendance*`.
* Injects `content.js` and `styles.css` into the attendance page.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Data Extraction</summary>

* Robust Selectors: Multiple DOM queries plus `MutationObserver` to handle dynamic content.
* Table Parsing: Extracts course code/name, total, present, duty leave, absent, medical leave.
* Retry Logic: Polling and exponential backoff for slow-loading pages.

</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Calculations</summary>

* Attendance % = `(present + dutyLeave) / totalClasses * 100`
* Bunkable: Max classes you can skip to stay at or above 75%.
* Recovery: Classes needed to reach 75% if below threshold.

</details>

<details>
<summary>4. User Interfaces</summary>

* Floating Widget: Draggable, collapsible, remembers its position in `localStorage`.
* Extension Popup: Card-based summary with color codes:

  * Safe (75% or above)
  * Warning (70–75%)
  * Danger (below 70%)

</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Storage & Updates</summary>

* Caches parsed data in Chrome `storage.local` for instant popup rendering.
* On popup open, fetches fresh data via message passing from `content.js`.
* Designed for seamless updates—simply push new versions to respective extension stores.

</details>
